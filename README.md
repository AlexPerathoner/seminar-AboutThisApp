# AboutThisAppView

*A standard "About This App" view for any Mac app*

## About

This library provides a standard "About This App" view for Mac apps. It requires **zero configuration by default** for most projects, but it can also be easily customized.

It is used in my apps [Red Eye](https://www.hexedbits.com/redeye/) and [Lucifer](https://www.hexedbits.com/lucifer/).
